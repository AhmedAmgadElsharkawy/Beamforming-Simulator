## Features

- **Real-time Beam Steering**: Customize system parameters such as the number of transmitters/receivers, applied delays/phase shifts, and operating frequencies. Control the beam direction in real-time for dynamic simulations.

- **Phased Array Geometry Customization**: Adjust the geometry of the phased array, including options for linear or curved arrays. Curvature parameters are also customizable for advanced beamforming configurations.

- **Constructive/Destructive Interference Visualization**: View the interference pattern map, showcasing regions of constructive and destructive interference, along with the beam profile in synchronized visualizers.

- **Multiple Phased Array Units**: Add and customize multiple phased array units to the system. Modify their locations and individual parameters to simulate complex beamforming scenarios.

- **Pre-configured Scenarios**: Load and explore at least three different scenarios inspired by real-world applications such as 5G, Ultrasound, and tumor ablation. Users can visualize and fine-tune the parameters of each scenario.
